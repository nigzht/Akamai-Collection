# Akamai Collection

## Collect any data needed by Akamai.

### Getting Started

Just make sure you have typescript installed on your machine to compile to js, then `tsc` to build and open the index.html script.

### Todo

- Analyze and improve data harvested
- Integrate with API(I have this code already, I may add it upon request)
- further html file to include any other cases included in akamai

### Contributing

If you think something should be added, I encourage you to make a pull request and I will get back to you ASAP.

### Issues

If there is something wrong, please open an issue and I will address it :)
